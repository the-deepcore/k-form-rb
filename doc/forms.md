# k-form-rb

A custom Rails form builder that takes leverage of components written in Vue.JS. Inspired by [vue-rails-form-builder](https://github.com/kuroda/vue-rails-form-builder)

Should be used in pair with [k-form-js](https://github.com/kundigo/k-form-js)

Synopsis
--------

```erb
<%= bs4_vue_form_with User.new do |f| %>
  <%= f.text_field :name %>
<% end %>
```

```html
<form ...>
  ...
  <k-input type="text" name="user[name]" ... />
</form>
```

# Installation

Add the following line to `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "k-form-rb", 
     :git => "https://github.com/kundigo/k-form-rb.git",
     :branch => 'master'
```

Run `bundle install` in the terminal.

And then run `bundle exec rails k_form_rb:install` in the terminal. This command will

* add the glue code between stimulus and vuejs forms
* add [k-form-js](https://github.com/kundigo/k-form-js) to `package.json`

# Testing

Since this library relies heavily on hooking on forms generated by rails apps, tests will be done later in a dummy application using feature tests.

Options
-------

To `bs4_vue_form_with` methods you can provide the same options as for `form_with`.

There is a special option:

* `:form_tag_name` - the html tag to be used (by defaul `k-form`)
